                  I'm Joe Wright, and I am currently enrolled at the UNC Chapel Hill coding bootcamp.  I've worked adjacent to development teams as a business intelligence professional for some time, and am excited to finally be taking the leap to become a full stack web engineer.  My passion is for the front end--incorporating my artist's eye to bring a particular and individualistic style to ux for brands people remember.

                  I am currently seeking a role to apply my developer and artistic skill set to where I can enjoy an excellent culture fit and a team-driven collaborative developing environment.  My hobbies include music--playing and attending--, painting, lithography, camping, and spending time with my cat and dog.  I also spend a lot of time freelancing as an artist in the music industry for concept design and branding.  Thank you for taking a moment to visit my site!
